  <DND_MoodndAnimalSpawnMultiplierTooltip>This multiplier will affect the spawn changes (commonalities) of ALL animals in this mod. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then animals from the mod will spawn half as much as default (which is 1). If set to 2, you'll get twice as many as default, and so on. This only affects wild spawns.</DND_MoodndAnimalSpawnMultiplierTooltip>
  <DND_IndividualSpawnSettingsNote>Note: Toggles to control whether specific animals can naturally spawn in the wild can be found under the 'Vanilla Animals Expanded' mod settings tab.</DND_IndividualSpawnSettingsNote>

  <DND_MoodndRewardMultiplierTooltip>This multiplier will affect the quest reward rate (commonalities) of ALL animals in this mod. For example, if this is set to 0.5, then items from the mod will appear as quest rewards half as much as the default (which is 1). If set to 2, you'll see quest rewards from this mod twice as often, and so on.</DND_MoodndRewardMultiplierTooltip>
