	<description>This mod adds over a dozen Dungeons and Dragons-inspired animals to Rimworld. Given the antagonistic nature of most creatures in DnD, many of these animals only appear as part of raids from a unique faction, while others are loyal allies that must be acquired or built. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Animal List&lt;/size&gt; 

     - Golems: Extremely powerful guardians that be constructed from either human flesh, stone, or steel. In order to build one, you must first find a manual of golems from quests or traders. Even the weakest one is more powerful than a thrumbo. Their main drawback is that they have no natural healing, so they must be occasionally repaired.
     - Animated Furniture: Made by using a scroll of animation item on furniture. Their exact stats depend on the quality and material of the original furniture. Each type of furniture also has a different behavior. Current valid furniture types include dining chairs, tool cabinets, and stools.
     - Flumph: A friendly, psychic jellyfish that be tamed to produce a psychic-boosting drug.
     - Faerie Dragon: A small friendly dragon that can keep colonists happy but unready for combat with their eupohira breath.     
     - Basilisk: A large reptile that can pretrify prey.
     - Medusa: A dangerous creature with a very powerful petrification attack. Only appears in raids.
     - Owlbear: A deadly predator with an unnaturally large appetite. Its damage and armor penetration are much higher than you'd expect for a creature of its size.
     - Displacer Beast: A large magical feline that distorts light around its body. Boasts a high dodge chance, which is passed onto clothing made from its pelt.
     - Gibbering Mouther: An unnatural blob of flesh that disorients nearby creatures with noise. Appears very rarely outside of raids.
     - Beholder: A malevolent, otherworldly creature that shoots magical beams with a variety of effects. Only appears in late-game raids.
     - Spectator: A small cousin of beholders. Can be summoned using eyestalks harvested from beholders.    
     - Rust Monster: A strange crustacean that eats rusted metals. Keep away from your metal stockpiles and armored warriors.
     - Annihilator: A predatory cousin of rust monsters that disintegrates prey and consumes the resulting dust. Keep away from your... everything. Only appears in raids.
     
&lt;size=24&gt;Mod compatability&lt;/size&gt;

This is my first mod, and I've made zero efforts at mod compatability thus far. That said, this mod doesn't do too much beyond adding animals, so I don't expect too many problems. I do intend to make this mod compatable with the following mods:
    
A dog said and related mods
...Whatever else commonly needs patches for animal mods. I'm sure people will point them out.
 
I do not have any intention of making this mod compatable with the following mods:

Combat Extended: I've never used this mod, and don't intend to plan around it. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Balance is the main concern. I based most of the combat stats off of vanilla animals, and did some playtesting, but there are several new combat mechanics that can warp combat a bit. I'm certainly open to feedback regarding resistance, shield-pierce rates for magical attacks, and general dps/tankiness of creatures.
    
Other issues to be noted if/when they arise...
